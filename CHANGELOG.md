### Major Release: Longform Video Rendering

This release introduces asynchronous longform video rendering capabilities with significant new features.

### Added

#### Longform Video Rendering
- **NEW:** Async processing system for longform videos (up to 2 hours)
- **NEW:** SQLite database for job tracking and persistence
- **NEW:** Background worker for processing video jobs
- **NEW:** Support for audio-driven video creation with background media
- **NEW:** Three new API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/longform/render` - Queue render job
  - `GET /api/v1/longform/status/{request_id}` - Check job status
  - `GET /api/v1/longform/result/{request_id}` - Get completed result

#### Features
- Support for 1-30 audio URLs (concatenated automatically)
- Two background source types:
  - **Images:** 1-15 URLs supported
  - **Videos:** 1-5 URLs supported (automatically muted)
- Fixed 16:9 aspect ratio for longform videos
- Quality options: 720p (1280x720) or 1080p (1920x1080)
- Automatic background media looping to match audio duration
- Maximum video duration: 2 hours (7200 seconds)
- Final video length always matches total audio length (capped at 2h)

#### Technical Infrastructure
- SQLite database with migration system

## Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.0

### No Breaking Changes for Existing Endpoints

The v2.0 release is **fully backward compatible** with v1.x for the video merge endpoint. Existing integrations will continue to work without changes.

### What's New

If you want to use the new longform rendering features:

1. **Update dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Update environment variables:**
   Add `DATABASE_PATH` to your `.env` file (optional, defaults to `jobs.db`)

3. **Use new endpoints:**
   - See `API-DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete examples
   - Use `/api/v1/longform/render` for async video creation
   - Poll `/api/v1/longform/status/{request_id}` for job status
   - Fetch result from `/api/v1/longform/result/{request_id}`

### Database

- SQLite database is created automatically on first startup
- No manual migration required
- Database file location: `DATABASE_PATH` env var (default: `jobs.db`)

### Worker

- Background worker starts automatically with the application
- No additional configuration needed
- Processes one job at a time (sequential)

### v2.1 (Potential)
- Multiple concurrent workers
